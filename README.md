# Imgur API Gallery React

With an API request I get the images and other parameters. On the front page you can see the images and their description. 

It has 4 filters:
  1. Gallery section: hot, top, user. 
  2. Sort: viral, top, time, rising. 
  3. Window: day, week, month, year. 
  4. Show viral: boolean (checked by default, it shows viral images). 

If you click on an image you can see other details (likes, scores, dislikes and views number).

Page is also responsive. 

# IMPORTANT NOTE:
  On App.js line 46 add your api key inside the "Bearer " 
  
  Example: myHeaders.append("Authorization", "Bearer df0f83d526c5352587af71c55c88f1ef4a4f860d");
